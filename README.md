# Echo-Cancellation-Using-LMS-Algorithm
We developed to mitigate  unwanted echoes in a communication system.Echo cancellation is crucial in scenarios where echoes occur, such as in telecommunication systems, VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) calls, and audio conferencing. optimize the LMS algorithm for echo cancellation in real-time voice communication systems.
